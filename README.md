# AAI-IOT-SmartHouse

Overview

The Smart House Project aims to integrate advanced IoT (Internet of Things) and deep learning technologies to create an intelligent home automation system. This project leverages data from household sensors and appliances to optimize energy consumption and improve overall home management through predictive analytics.
Features

Energy Management: Utilizes predictive models (ARIMA and LSTM) to optimize electricity use, reducing costs and environmental impact.

Appliance Control: Eventually allowing for remote and automated control of household appliances via a user-friendly interface.

Predictive Maintenance: Eventually predicting potential issues with appliances and systems, facilitating timely maintenance.

Real-Time Monitoring: Utilizing Tableau for visual reporting of past conditions and predicted future conditions to utilize for user management.
